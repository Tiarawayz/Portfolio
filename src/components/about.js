      <h4>As a kid my passions were always computers and music. As I am now an adult it's still the same.<br></br> This is where I shine the most and I can showcase how creative and talented I am. Iâ€™m always open to learning new things and improving myself.<br></br> And as a software engineer that's where all my quality will come through and help me become a better engineer.<br></br> The willingness to learn new things, try new things, as well as create new ways to do things will come as easily as it did my whole life.<br></br> I always stand outside the box and inspect everything as I work.<br></br> I can work as a team as well as stand on my own if times call for it. </h4>
